Target â†’ Shooter feedback system

Project for usage in conjunction with two ethernet connected Raspberry Pi's (3 B+).

One works as a sender of target hit location and stores that for printing at a later stage, while the other is the reciver which will display the most recent hit location and the current shooter series.
